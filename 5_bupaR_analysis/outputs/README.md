This directory contains local BupaR process-mining outputs and derived features.

For each `(cohort_name, age_band, window)` (e.g. `opioid_ed`, `0_12`, `train`),
we store:
- Trace summaries
- Process matrices
- Pre-/post-F1120 per-patient sequence features

These CSVs are designed to be joined back into the model_data training dataset.***
