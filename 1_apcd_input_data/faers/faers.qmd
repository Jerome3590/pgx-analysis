## FAERS Data Analysis Pipeline

This notebook processes and analyzes the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) dataset. The analysis includes data cleaning, drug name normalization, polypharmacy analysis, and visualization of adverse drug events.

### Setup and Dependencies

```{r}

library(here)
library(reticulate)

```

```{python}

import pandas as pd
from io import BytesIO
import boto3
import duckdb
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

```

### Data Loading and Initial Setup

This section sets up the connection to the S3 bucket and loads the FAERS dataset.

```{python}

# Define cohort and S3 paths
s3_bucket = "pgxdatalake"
s3_prefix = f"faers"

faers_input_path = f"s3://{s3_bucket}/{s3_prefix}/**/*.parquet"

# Enable S3 support in DuckDB
duckdb.sql("INSTALL httpfs; LOAD httpfs;")

# AWS Credentials
duckdb.sql("CALL load_aws_credentials('pgx');")

# Check schema by selecting zero rows
faers_schema = duckdb.sql(f"SELECT * FROM read_parquet('{faers_input_path}') LIMIT 0").df()

print("FAERS Schema:\n", faers_schema)

```

### Data Deduplication

This section ensures we're working with unique records by removing duplicates.

```{python}

# Check for duplicates
duckdb.sql("""
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_records,
       COUNT(DISTINCT *) as unique_records
FROM faers
""")

# Create a view with distinct records
duckdb.sql("""
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW faers_deduplicated AS
SELECT DISTINCT *
FROM faers
""")

# Verify deduplication
duckdb.sql("""
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_records,
       COUNT(DISTINCT *) as unique_records
FROM faers_deduplicated
""")

```

### Drug Name Normalization

This section standardizes drug names using a combination of text processing and mapping files. The process includes: 1. Basic text cleaning (special characters, case normalization) 2. Standardization of drug combinations 3. Application of predefined drug name mappings

```{python}

# Load drug mappings
import json
from pathlib import Path

def load_drug_mappings():
    mappings = {}
    mappings_dir = Path('../drug_mappings')
    
    for mapping_file in mappings_dir.glob('*_mappings.json'):
        letter = mapping_file.stem[0]  # Get first letter from filename
        with open(mapping_file, 'r') as f:
            mappings[letter] = json.load(f)
    
    # Combine all mappings into a single dictionary
    combined_mappings = {}
    for letter_mappings in mappings.values():
        combined_mappings.update(letter_mappings)
    
    return combined_mappings

# Create normalized drug names view with mappings
duckdb.sql("""
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW faers_drugs_normalized AS
WITH normalized_drugs AS (
    SELECT 
        -- Basic normalization
        lower(trim(regexp_replace(drugname, "[_\"\'():;,.!?\\-]", " "))) as drugname_cleaned,
        -- Replace spaces with underscores
        replace(drugname_cleaned, ' ', '_') as drugname_underscore,
        -- Replace '/' with '+'
        replace(drugname_underscore, '/', '+') as drugname_plus,
        -- Sort combinations if they contain '+'
        CASE 
            WHEN contains(drugname_plus, '+') 
            THEN array_to_string(array_sort(string_to_array(drugname_plus, '+')), '+')

SELECT 
    drugname as original_name,
    drugname_normalized as normalized_name,
    *

""")

# Apply drug mappings
drug_mappings = load_drug_mappings()

# Create a temporary table for mappings
duckdb.sql("""
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE drug_mappings AS

    ','.join(f"('{k}', '{v}')" for k, v in drug_mappings.items())
))

# Apply mappings to normalized names
duckdb.sql("""
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW faers_drugs_mapped AS
SELECT 
    f.*,
    COALESCE(m.mapped_name, f.normalized_name) as final_drug_name

""")

# Show sample of mapped drug names
duckdb.sql("""

""")

```

### Polypharmacy Analysis

This section analyzes drug combinations and their frequencies in the dataset.

```{python}

# Add Polypharmacy
duckdb.sql("""
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW polypharmacy_faers AS
SELECT 
    drugs,
    COUNT(*) as occurences,
    array_length(drugs) as polypharmacy

ORDER BY polypharmacy DESC
""")

# View polypharmacy
duckdb.sql("""
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW view_polypharmacy AS
SELECT *
FROM polypharmacy_faers
WHERE polypharmacy > 3 AND polypharmacy < 12
""")

```

### FAERS Event Processing

This section processes adverse event data, including: 1. Date parsing and duration calculation 2. Cleaning and filtering of events 3. Handling of missing age and weight data

```{python}

# FAERS Events
duckdb.sql("""
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW faers_events AS
SELECT 
    primaryid,
    caseid,
    to_date(as.character(start_dt), 'yyyyMMdd') as drug_date,
    to_date(as.character(event_dt), 'yyyyMMdd') as event_date,
    datediff(event_date, drug_date) as duration,
    age,
    age_cod,
    gndr_cod,
    wt,
    wt_cod,
    drugs,
    array_length(drugs) as polypharmacy,
    outc_cod
FROM faers
WHERE event_dt IS NOT NULL
AND start_dt IS NOT NULL
AND length(start_dt) = 8
AND (outc_cod = 'HO' OR outc_cod = 'DE')
AND length(event_dt) = 8
""")

# Clean FAERS Events
duckdb.sql("""
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW faers_events_cleaned AS
SELECT *
FROM faers_events
WHERE duration > 0 AND duration < 30
QUALIFY ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY primaryid, caseid ORDER BY duration) = 1

# Update missing age and weight
duckdb.sql("""
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW faers_events_age_updated AS
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN age IS NULL THEN CAST(gndr_cod AS INTEGER)
        ELSE age

    CASE 
        WHEN age = CAST(gndr_cod AS INTEGER) THEN wt_cod
        ELSE gndr_cod

        WHEN age < 100 THEN 'YR'
        ELSE age_cod
    END as age_cod,
    CASE 
        WHEN wt IS NULL THEN wt
        ELSE wt_cod
    END as wt_cod,
    *

# Polypharmacy events
duckdb.sql("""

""")

```

### Outcomes Analysis

This section analyzes the distribution of outcome codes in the dataset.

```{python}

# Count Outcomes
duckdb.sql("""
SELECT 
    outc_cod,
    COUNT(*) as count
FROM faers_deduplicated
GROUP BY outc_cod
ORDER BY count DESC
""")

```

### Missing Data Analysis

This section examines the completeness of age and weight data before and after updates.

```{python}

# Check missing age and weight
duckdb.sql("""
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_events,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE age IS NULL) as missing_age,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE wt IS NULL) as missing_weight
FROM faers_events_cleaned
""")

# Check missing data after updates
duckdb.sql("""
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_events,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE age IS NULL) as missing_age,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE wt IS NULL) as missing_weight
FROM faers_events_age_updated
""")

```

## Data Visualizations

This section creates visualizations to understand patterns in the data: 1. Hospitalizations over time 2. Polypharmacy patterns 3. Age group distributions 4. Event duration patterns

#### Hospitalizations By Year

```{python}

# Hospitalizations by Year

#### Time to Event (Duration) Analysis

```{python}

# Duration Analysis
duration_data = duckdb.sql("""
    SELECT 
        duration,
        COUNT(*) as case_count
