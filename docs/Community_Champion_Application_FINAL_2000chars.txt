Healthcare claims data contains millions of records, but translating this into actionable clinical insights remains challenging. I propose presenting a multi-method analytical framework combining five complementary approaches—FPGrowth pattern discovery, BupaR process mining, CatBoost predictive modeling, DTW trajectory clustering, and enhanced CatBoost with causal attribution—to transform claims data into clinically actionable insights.

The presentation addresses two critical questions: (1) Which drugs in a 30-day window predict non-opioid ED visits? (2) What ICD/CPT codes and drugs predict opioid-related ED events? Each method provides unique perspectives—discovering patterns, analyzing sequences, predicting outcomes, clustering trajectories, and assessing causality. Together, they bridge data science and clinical practice, enabling early warning systems, risk stratification, and personalized interventions.

Props: Method cards (5 double-sided), results handouts, large-format trajectory/process flow visualizations, feature importance charts, interactive tablet demo, and cohort comparison table. These create an interactive, multi-sensory experience accommodating different learning styles.

Why Select Me: This presentation offers unique value through (1) novel integration of five complementary methods demonstrating how combining them provides more comprehensive insights than any single approach; (2) strong translational value—addressing the gap between data science and clinical practice, emphasizing how results translate into actionable insights (early warnings, risk stratification, personalized interventions); (3) practical applicability—immediately applicable to pharmacovigilance and drug safety monitoring with concrete applications relevant to clinical pharmacy practice; (4) educational value—teaching framework showing how methods complement each other and when to use each; (5) comprehensive story—complete narrative from problem through method selection, results, and clinical translation; (6) interactive engagement—multi-prop approach accommodating diverse learning styles; (7) real-world impact—addressing opioid-related outcomes and drug safety with actionable insights. This practical, innovative, and educational contribution bridges methodological rigor with clinical relevance, making it ideal for Community Champion selection.
