# Community Champion Application: Pharmacy Translational Informatics

## Topic Description

**Title**: "Translating Healthcare Claims Data into Clinically Actionable Insights: A Multi-Method Framework for Drug Pattern Analysis and Outcome Prediction"

**Brief Description**:

Healthcare claims data contains millions of records with complex drug, diagnosis, and procedure patterns, but translating this data into actionable clinical insights remains a significant challenge. I propose to present a **multi-method analytical framework** that combines five complementary approaches—FPGrowth pattern discovery, BupaR process mining, CatBoost predictive modeling, DTW trajectory clustering, and enhanced CatBoost with causal attribution—to transform raw claims data into clinically actionable insights.

The presentation addresses two critical research questions: (1) **Which drugs in a 30-day window predict non-opioid ED visits?** and (2) **What ICD/CPT codes and drugs predict opioid-related ED events?** Each analytical method provides a unique perspective—from discovering frequent patterns to analyzing temporal sequences, predicting outcomes, clustering similar patient trajectories, and assessing causal relationships. Together, these methods bridge the gap between data science and clinical practice, enabling early warning systems, risk stratification, and personalized interventions for drug safety monitoring.

The translational informatics approach demonstrates how combining multiple analytical methods provides more comprehensive understanding than any single method alone, ultimately supporting evidence-based clinical decision-making and improving patient outcomes.

## Suggested Props

1. **Method Cards** (5 double-sided cards): Visual cards for each analytical method (FPGrowth, BupaR, CatBoost, DTW, Enhanced CatBoost) with front showing method name/icon and back containing detailed explanations and example outputs. These allow the audience to engage with each method individually and serve as take-home references.

2. **Results Summary Handouts**: Multi-page handout showing top drug patterns, ICD/CPT codes, trajectory cluster descriptions, and feature importance rankings. Provides detailed findings that complement the single-slide overview.

3. **Large-Format Visualizations**:
   - **Trajectory Cluster Diagram**: Visual representation of patient trajectory clusters identified through DTW analysis, showing how patients with similar healthcare journeys are grouped together.
   - **Process Flow Diagram**: Sankey diagram or process flow showing drug/ICD/CPT sequences leading to outcomes (e.g., "Drug A → Drug B → ED Visit" pathways).
   - **Feature Importance Chart**: Horizontal bar chart ranking top predictive features (drugs, ICD codes, CPT codes) from CatBoost analysis.

4. **Interactive Demo** (Tablet/Laptop): Live demonstration of trajectory clustering visualization or SHAP value analysis, allowing audience members to explore the analytical outputs interactively.

5. **Cohort Comparison Table**: Side-by-side comparison of ED_NON_OPIOID and OPIOID_ED cohorts, highlighting differences in temporal windows, analysis approaches, and key findings.

These props transform the presentation from a passive slide show into an interactive, multi-sensory learning experience, allowing audience members to engage with the material at different levels of detail based on their interests and expertise.

## Why I Should Be Selected as Community Champion

I should be selected as Community Champion because this presentation offers a **unique and practical contribution** to the pharmacy translational informatics community:

**1. Novel Multi-Method Integration**: While individual analytical methods (FPGrowth, BupaR, CatBoost, DTW) are well-known, demonstrating their **complementary integration** in a single framework is innovative. The presentation shows how each method answers different questions and how combining them provides more comprehensive insights than any single approach.

**2. Strong Translational Value**: The work directly addresses the critical gap between data science and clinical practice. Rather than focusing solely on methodological advances, the presentation emphasizes **how analytical results translate into actionable clinical insights**—early warning systems, risk stratification, and personalized interventions.

**3. Practical Applicability**: The methods and findings are immediately applicable to real-world pharmacovigilance and drug safety monitoring. The presentation demonstrates **concrete applications** such as identifying high-risk drug patterns, predicting adverse outcomes, and clustering patients for personalized care—all directly relevant to clinical pharmacy practice.

**4. Educational Value**: The multi-method framework serves as a **teaching tool** for the community, showing how different analytical approaches complement each other and when to use each method. This educational component benefits both researchers and practitioners.

**5. Comprehensive Story**: The presentation tells a complete story—from problem identification through method selection, results interpretation, and clinical translation—providing a **holistic view** of translational informatics that is rarely presented in a single session.

**6. Interactive Engagement**: The use of multiple props and visualizations creates an **engaging, multi-sensory experience** that accommodates different learning styles and allows audience members to explore the material at their own pace during and after the presentation.

**7. Real-World Impact**: The work addresses pressing public health challenges (opioid-related ED visits, drug safety monitoring) and demonstrates how informatics methods can contribute to **improving patient outcomes** and supporting evidence-based clinical decision-making.

In summary, this presentation offers the pharmacy translational informatics community a **practical, innovative, and educational** contribution that bridges methodological rigor with clinical relevance, making it an ideal fit for a Community Champion selection.
