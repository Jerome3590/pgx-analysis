    "# Feature Importance Cohort Runner (EC2)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is designed to run the **feature importance Monte Carlo CV pipeline** for all configured cohorts on an **EC2 instance**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cohort scripts**: `3_feature_importance/run_cohort_*.py`\n",
    "- **Data location (EC2)**: `/mnt/nvme/cohorts` (synced from `s3://pgxdatalake/gold/cohorts_F1120/`)\n",
    "- **Environment**: Python environment with `xgboost`, `catboost`, `lightgbm`, `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `numpy`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** Calculate scaled feature importance across various ML algorithms  \n",
    "**Method:** Normalized feature importance scaled by MC-CV Recall scores  \n",
    "**Hardware:** Optimized for EC2 (32 cores, 1TB RAM)  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Performance Optimizations\n",
    "\n",
    "🚀 **Parallel Processing** – Leverages all available CPU cores for maximum performance:\n",
    "- **Feature Matrix Creation**: Parallel column-by-column construction using `joblib.Parallel` (uses `cpu_count() - 2` workers)\n",
    "- **MC-CV Splits**: Parallel execution of Monte Carlo cross-validation splits (uses `cpu_count() - 2` workers)\n",
    "- **Memory Efficient**: Replaced memory-intensive `pivot_table` with incremental column building to handle large cohorts (32,000+ features)\n",
    "\n",
    "💾 **Memory Optimization**:\n",
    "- Column-by-column feature matrix construction reduces peak memory usage\n",
    "- Optimized for large cohorts (e.g., age band 25-44 with 78,000+ patients and 32,000+ features)\n",
    "- Efficient handling of sparse categorical features for CatBoost\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Monte Carlo Cross-Validation** – up to 1000 random train/test splits (200-split runs used for faster iteration)  \n",
    "✅ **Stratified Sampling** - Maintains target distribution  \n",
    "✅ **95% Confidence Intervals** - Narrow, precise estimates (tighter with more splits)  \n",
    "✅ **Multiple Models** - CatBoost, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, Extra Trees, Logistic Regression, LinearSVC, ElasticNet, Lasso  \n",
    "✅ **Permutation-Based Feature Importance** - Model-agnostic importance calculation for fair comparison across models  \n",
    "✅ **Idempotent Workflow** - Automatically skips models with existing results (checks local files first, then S3)  \n",
    "✅ **Parallel Processing** - Leverages all available CPU cores for feature matrix creation and MC-CV splits (uses `cpu_count() - 2` workers)  \n",
    "✅ **Memory Optimized** - Column-by-column feature matrix construction handles large cohorts (32,000+ features, 78,000+ patients)  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements the feature selection methodology:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load cohort data from parquet files (same as FP-Growth notebook)\n",
    "2. Create patient-level features (one-hot encoding of items)\n",
    "   - **Optimized**: Parallel feature matrix creation for CatBoost categorical features\n",
    "   - Filters constant features globally before MC-CV splits\n",
    "3. For each model type:\n",
    "   - Create 200 stratified train/test splits (parallelized across all cores)\n",
    "   - Train model on training set\n",
    "   - Evaluate Recall on unseen test set\n",
    "   - Extract permutation-based feature importance\n",
    "   - Aggregate results across splits\n",
    "4. Normalize and scale feature importance by MC-CV Recall\n",
    "5. Aggregate across models\n",
    "6. Extract top features\n",
    "\n",
    "## Output Files\n",
    "\n",
    "All results are saved locally and uploaded to S3:\n",
    "- **Individual model results**: `{cohort}_{age_band}_{method}_feature_importance.csv`\n",
    "- **Aggregated results**: `{cohort}_{age_band}_aggregated_feature_importance.csv`\n",
    "- **Constant features**: `{cohort}_{age_band}_constant_features.csv`\n",
    "- **S3 location**: `s3://pgxdatalake/gold/feature_importance/{cohort}/{age_band}/`"
